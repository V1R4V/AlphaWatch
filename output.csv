We specialize on early stage opportunities that are prepared to tackle global markets.

Our original approach aims at creating global success stories by bridging the gap between high quality engineering and commercial execution.

Some startups face scarcity of technical talent, the others lack business scaling skills or experience challenges of small domestic markets. We help them to bridge these gaps by connecting superb global entrepreneurs with top-notch technical talent. This is a key value-add to our portfolio companies.

Today we prioritize post-PC era technologies that narrow the divide between humans and machines. These technologies have potential to create significant impact in the years to come.

• Big data and analytics, cognitive computing and Internet of Things that provide decision support with automation to humans and awareness with intelligence to machines

• Enterprise of the future embraces technologies that augment, replace or work together with humans to improve productivity, transform customer experience and gain competitive advantage

• Always/everywhere platform and applications including ambient and location intelligence, gestures control, mobile health monitoring, and virtual assistance among others.

Our team of experienced professionals has strong technology operating background, solid venture investing experience and long history in key global innovation ecosystems.

Previously known as Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg announced the company rebrand to Meta on October 28, 2021 at the company's annual Connect Conference.

Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, California in 2004. With millions of more users, [Friendster] attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid-2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners] at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook continued to grow opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding a photo-sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners] and [Meritech Capital] as well as previous investors [Accel Partners] and [Peter Thiel]. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally, in September 2006, Facebook was opened to anyone with an email address.

Facebook continued to receive funding most notably in January 2011 receiving $1.5 billion and valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012 opening in [NASDAQ] with shares trading at $42.05.

Facebook announced positive numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013 over 1.15 billion users have logged into Facebook every month and 669 million users daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the United States. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo-sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.

The company has a strategic partnership with AXA Group to develop marketing and commercial collaboration in the digital, social, and mobile sphere.

Facebook is currently the owner of many applications and services such as Pagemodo Pagebuilder, [RSS Graffiti], Huddle, and more. It is the world’s largest social network with over 1.32 billion monthly active users."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/whm4ed1rrc8skbdi3biv

Cakovec, Medimurska, Croatia, Europe	HR	559739	"TokenStars is the first celebrity management platform on the blockchain, providing advanced tools and incentives for deeper interaction between stars, fans, and advertisers. Having successfully started with the ​​ACE ​t​oken sale ​f​or ​t​ennis, ​TokenStars has enhanced its team with top-notch experts and stars to launch the TEAM token: Lothar Matthäus, Valery Karpin (football), Tommy Haas, Robin Söderling, Cedric Pioline, Anastasia Myskina (tennis), Nikita Kucherov (hockey), Alexander Anter (poker) and Rico Torres (Hollywood) are among the famous celebrities supporting TokenStars. 

Designed as a toolkit, the TokenStars platform consists of 12 integrated modules grouped in 4 layers by function:
1) crowdfunding, enabling prospective talents to raise funds;
2) infrastructure, providing the community with tools for key activities (scouting, voting, betting);
3) fan community, allowing celebrities to grow their social capital and offering fans higher involvement;
4) advertising, delivering smart and transparent data as well as engaged audiences to brands for more efficient promotion campaigns.

As a utility token, TEAM will be used in most of the interaction activities powered by the TokenStars platform, including repayment of agency commissions from advertisers and supported talents, providing incentives to fans and external agents for finding promising talents (scouts) and for promoting celebrities (promoters), making betting bids, participating in the voting polls, getting access to exclusive offers from celebrities, and so on.

TokenStars develops its platform on the blockchain to make it transparent and verifiable, create a powerful global community, ensure lower money transfer costs and faster transactions with no need in a third party, as well as to eliminate middlemen in and bring more transparency to the celebrity management industry.

Based on a proven business model, TokenStars is lead by an experienced team with background at Groupon, Leo Burnett, Evernote, Rambler&Co and Mail.Ru Group. It is supported by blockchain advisors Tomoaki Sato (Starbase), Wulf Kaal (University of St. Thomas) and Edgar Kampers (Qoin).

Washington, District of Columbia, United States, North America	US	14836	"The White House is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of the United States. It is one of the most recognizable buildings in Washington, D.C. and was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born and-trained architect who won a competition organized by President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in 1792.


President John Adams, elected in 1796 as the second President, was the first resident of the White House. Abigail Adams, President Adams' wife, was known to have complained about the largely unfinished new residence. President Thomas Jefferson, upon moving to the house in 1801, was also not impressed, and dismissed the house as being too big. Jefferson made several structural changes under architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe such as the addition of terrace-pavilions on either side of the main building and single-story wings for storage.


In addition to replacing the slate roof with one of sheet iron, Jefferson further improved the grounds by landscaping them in a picturesque manner. While James Madison was President from 1809 to 1817, the White House was torched by the British in the War of 1812. Although the fire was put out by a summer thunderstorm, all that remained were the outside, charred walls and the interior brick walls. Madison brought Hoban back to restore the mansion, which took three years. It was during this construction that the house was painted white. Hoban later added the South and North Porticos, using a slightly altered design by Latrobe. Thereafter, further more alterations were made.


Today, the White House Complex includes the executive residence, west wing, east wing, the Eisenhower executive office building—the former state department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president—and Blair House, a guest residence. The executive residence is made up of six stories—the ground floor, state floor, second floor, and third floor, as well as a two-story basement. The term White House is often used as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of the United States and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America's Favorite Architecture."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/bekgcsagfdwxigwq8akv

Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal, Europe	PT	69776	"Climber is a Revenue Management Software (RMS) for small hotel chains. We provide intelligent pricing for the hospitality industry, helping hotels maximize revenue with an automatic and self-learning software that detects opportunities and takes immediate actions. 

Climber taps into a hotel’s existing reservation system and puts its machine learning to work by not only considering the historical data of the hotel but also the market demand (air traffic, local events, weather forecast, online reputation).

We have an exceptional team of 14 strong individuals (9 nationalities) with complimentary skills from Data Science, Engineers, Sales to Marketing.  Everyone is operating in-person from our offices in Lisbon. A complimentary mix of hustling, Revenue Management expertise and Data Science/Mathematicians.

There is a growing demand for accommodation globally and that's particularly obvious in most city hotels who are often fully booked. Managing the existing inventory and maximizing the profit is a key challenge of small hotel chains today since technology has had limited impact. From the software stack perspective a hotel typically should use three types of software (PMS + Channel Manager + RMS) and we understood that for hotels that have the need to optimize their revenue it's impossible without data driven software. We understood as well that there is a big gap in the hotel space since small hotel chains don't have access to accessible Revenue Management Systems. Due to the lack of financial capacity and know-how on how to use the current complex and expensive Revenue management systems on the market, small hotel chains end up doing daily analysis on spreadsheets that are both time-consuming and information-poor resulting in making decisions that leave hotels running below their full revenue potential. 

Climber tackle the needs of small hotel chains by providing an accessible solution that is easy to use, fast to integrate and automated, replacing the manual labor on daily analysis and reporting that before was costing the hotels a massive amount of time."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/v1432811678/rhahrpgujh1jji2mhdtb.png

Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel, Asia	IL	128556	"Currently, hotel groups and brands are using indicators that measure their properties’ performance levels after the guest already leaves the property; this is how they are obtaining guest feedback as well. But isn’t that a little too late? Wouldn’t you rather be in-the-know of what’s going on during the guest’s stay instead of waiting for the guest to leave and then finding out, especially if the guest had a negative experience? It’s kind of like driving a car; you need the engine light or gas tank light to alert you ahead of time so that you can prevent your car from stalling or getting stuck. Imagine if you didn’t have those indicators and were driving never knowing what the status is. If you know in real-time, you can react quickly and solve the issue immediately so that it doesn’t cause problems. 
So we’re changing this. No longer will hotel groups have to drive blind. In fact, they and their properties will be empowered with the right information at the right time in order to ensure that every guest leaves their property with a smile. 
Their clients use Routier to identify, measure, and monitor their properties’ performance levels in real-time and gain the clarity they need to create benchmarks and data-driven business targets, form incentive programs that improve performance, optimize hotel operations and marketing effectiveness, and ensure all their properties are keeping up with brand standards. Routier’s Unified Performance Index (UPI) is a performance score, available exclusively to Routier clients, used by hotels and brands around the world as their standard measurement tool for benchmarking their properties’ operational and marketing efforts. 
 
Their platform is created to make their clients lives easier; they enable them to receive the information they need easily and react in a scalable manner. 

They have a robust set of solutions that are adapted for either guests, properties/staff, or brand/management level.
Their guest-facing engagement solution helps hotels and guests communicate with each other in real-time, during their stay, without downloading or installing a thing. Whether you want to measure satisfaction, identify issues, increase your loyalty enrollment, or deliver promotions or other marketing campaigns, you can do this all with their engagement tool. 
 
Routier for Guests:
•	Collect guest feedback in real-time and be in-the-know if your guest’s sentiment levels
•	Respond quickly to guest needs and ensure no guest leaves your venue unsatisfied
•	Create more informed guests by delivering the right message at the right time
•	Increase guest satisfaction and loyalty by exceeding guest expectations

Their back-of-the-house property solution automates all guest engagement processes for hotels and provides their staff with analytics and insights that improve and optimize staff and hotel performance, guest satisfaction, and ROI. 
 
Routier for Properties:
•	Identify satisfied guests and leverage the opportunity for upgrades, upsells, and more
•	Streamline operations by automating processes that were once manual
•	Optimize all digital marketing efforts for maximum return on marketing ROI
•	Improve issue response time with real-time alerts and notifications
•	Aggregate all your guest tickets into one cross-channel ticketing platform"	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/orunw04jqjmor59ek6kq

Today, the GnosisDAO treasury has effective control of over 150K ETH and 8 Million GNO tokens, with the GNO tokens vested over 8 years. 

A year later, in 2021, the xDAI and GnosisDAO communities voted to combine their vibrant ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain: An Ethereum forerunner companion that addresses scaling issues through solid engineering. Gnosis Chain is the associated execution-layer EVM chain for stable transactions. It uses the xDai token and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.

The Gnosis mission has always been centered on experimentation and building decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate information. While creating the prediction market platform, it became clear that Gnosis needed to build the infrastructure required to support it. 

As a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem.

Gnosis Safe (multisig and programmable account), Cow Protocol (formerly CowSwap and Gnosis Protocol), Conditional Tokens (prediction markets), Gnosis Auction, and Zodiac (standard and tooling for composable DAOs) are all products incubated by Gnosis. Their success is demonstrated by the recent spin-out of Cow Protocol and the formation of SafeDAO. By combining needs-driven development with deep technical expertise, Gnosis has built the decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/hj19qwcowd3jyryna6gp

With almost 16,000 students and 4,000 staff, UM offers a wide choice of academic programmes, all of which are designed to bring out the best in its students.

Maastricht University has used Problem-Based Learning (PBL) ever since it was founded and has been an expert in this field for over 35 years. PBL is more than just acquiring knowledge; it’s about exchanging knowledge in a challenging and effective way. Maastricht University makes the difference. With unique Europe-focused and international-oriented programmes. After all, UM is ""Leading in Learning"".

Researchers at UM work in multidisciplinary teams and in close cooperation with international institutes, business and industry. Our high-quality researchers have attracted international attention by taking the lead in several large European research projects. However, we’re not stopping there. Maastricht University’s research portfolio continues to attract national and international top researchers. But we also believe in young talent. That’s why UM integrates research into every level of our education.

UM can easily call itself the most international university in the Netherlands, almost 45% of our students and more than 30% of our teaching staff come from abroad. Most of our programmes are taught in English and European and international themes are deeply rooted in research and education. That creates an international atmosphere that's attractive to Dutch as well as international students and employees."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/v1408399514/njhcjljcojdimmqigkgs.jpg

Whether it be lighting retrofit or a solar installation, we manage the entire process from the initial analytics through construction.

At Sunnect Solar & Lighting our vision is one of enabling change.  We have made it our business model to help others take something that is old and inefficient and turn it into something that is modern and efficient.  Whether it’s outdated lighting systems that waste energy or the mindset that there is no way out from paying for the ever-increasing cost of electricity, we are dedicated to changing that.  We are also committed to staying flexible as a business.  As we grow and discover symmetries between what we do and other ideas that make just as much sense, we intend to be in the position to take them on.

It provides accurate, real-time indication of the product’s freshness with a tactile interface. This time and temperature response is calibrated to different food types to suit food suppliers' requirements. 

Globally, a third of food produced is wasted (FAO, 2015), with 60% of it still being safe for consumption. Mimica is creating the next generation of food expiry labelling that reduces food waste and improves safety. We project, based on previous research, that using Bump by Mimica will reduce retail food waste by 50% and home waste by 60%. Based on these estimates and consumption data verified by Mintel and WRAP, we expect Mimica to save up to 13.6 million tonnes of our first three food groups (juice, milk and meat) from landfill per year in European households alone.

Outlier Ventures has expanded its Base Camp program to partner with leading protocols such as Aptos, Filecoin / IPFS, Polygon, and Polkadot along with FARFETCH, to host dedicated accelerator programs for these Web3 ecosystems along with Ascent, Outlier Ventures’ advisory offering targeted at later stage teams. Through its blockchain agnostic approach, Outlier Ventures has achieved record growth, doubled its cohort intake year after year, and is on target to accelerate well over 100 startups in 2022, making it one of the most active investors in the space by deal volume and the most active Web3 accelerator globally and top 3 crypto investor globally by volume of investment.

Since its inception, Outlier Ventures has always viewed its portfolio as an open stack of technologies that contribute to a new web paradigm, referred to as Web3, based on principles that prioritize the sovereignty of the user, their data and digital wealth, over platform and shareholder supremacy. In January of 2021, Outlier Ventures published its thesis on the imminent arrival of the Metaverse, outlining how Web3 would serve as an operating system for an Open Metaverse."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/b8u6rp4dt5eqq3t3jyyw

Herzliya, Tel Aviv, Israel, Asia	IL	239134	"SnatchBot was founded by Henri and Avi Ben Ezra(myself), we are two entrepreneurial brothers who have thrived in the telecom industry for more than a decade The SnatchBot bot-building platform was launched in 2017 with the goal of expanding the accessibility of chatbots and making bot-building easy and free for all users in any application. Based in Israel, SnatchBot provides access to sophisticated, natural-language conversational bots with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions across all communication channels. https://snatchbot.me/
 
The platform provides robust administrative features and enterprise-grade security that comply with all regulatory mandates. Users can design bots that range from those which conduct simple conversational interactions to those with more complex functions and built-in integrations, such as action buttons, translation, payment processing and more. We have made bot-building intuitive, no coding or technical skills are required. Unlike other bot-building platforms, SnatchBot blends a comprehensive interface with the ability to build chatbots that can perform tasks with greater intelligence and sentiment analysis than ever before. 
 
Natural language understanding and artificial intelligence are some of the most challenging problems to solve in computer science, requiring sophisticated, deep-learning algorithms to be trained on massive amounts of data and infrastructure. SnatchBot democratizes these deep-learning technologies and scales automatically, negating the need to manage infrastructure. 
 
Snatchbot’s Bot-Building Platform is free and includes unlimited free messages and free support. We also offer our help to companies to create their bots and as of today, after launching our platform only few months ago, more than 12,000 bots have been created. We also provide SnatchBot Store, a marketplace that is fully integrated with SnatchBot's comprehensive bot-building platform and which provides more than 50+ ready-for-use templates for a wide variety of chatbots: including, but not limited to, those designed for customer service, banking, travel and tourism, and e-commerce. https://snatchbot.me/botstore/template"	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/v1488934140/o85gg17zplkgdyidu7vj.png

Their goal is to quickly seed good ideas so the entrepreneurs can get their companies off the ground.

After the boom and bust of the first Internet bubble, innovative Internet related companies are once again emerging, this time with clear business models and much broader markets. New web companies serve a market of hundreds of millions of people whose primary means of information, communication, research and shopping is the Internet. In addition, Israel is considered one of the high-tech hot spots in the world and has an entrepreneurial culture. Although the USA and China have been leaders in terms of Web initiatives, Israel has the potential of producing world class internet players.
Gemini and LightSpeed, two respected and leading Venture Capital funds, have decided to create a dedicated structure to invest in this emerging industry.

They search for companies with Israeli operations, at their earliest stages (or pre-A Round in â€œVC-speakâ€) are the target for Lab investments. Specific areas of interest include shopping, social networking, search technology, vertical applications, content production and distribution. They have a broad definition of the internet that they consider as a network. Therefore they are also interested in mobile and new television initiatives.

They fund companies and bring seed investment up to 1 million dollars. Their process enables them to make swift decisions. Since at early stage, especially in the internet industry where benchmarks are still rare, there is no special reason for leading heavy due diligence they focus mainly in understanding the potential of an idea and the ability of the founding team to bring it to successful execution.
Investment decision is taken commonly by the internet lab team member. After a first meeting you will rapidly meet their team and they will evaluate together the opportunity for investment.
During the seed period, they will work with the founding team and help achieving successful milestones. Although they are not an incubator, they will be able to provide numerous resources for networking, strategic partnerships, marketing strategy and recruitment."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/v1397179068/dc88bbf46024f9e95c8baaa927e53e09.png

Boston, Massachusetts, United States, North America	US	6643	"Neurala is the company behind The Neurala Brain—deep learning neural network software that makes smart products like cameras, robots, drones, toys and self-driving cars more autonomous and useful.

Unlike traditional AI companies, which designed for super computers connected to the Internet, our first project was for NASA to be used for autonomous planetary exploration. Super computers were not available. Battery life was limited. Fast internet access was impossible. Our deep learning neural networks had to be lightweight and perform in real-time without ground intervention.



With our constraints, we modeled the Neurala Brain on animal brains because animal brains are highly efficient “computers” that do more in less space and with less power consumption than the computers we use today.  The brain also knows how to use eyes (cameras) and ears (microphones). 

This approach worked and we are now bringing The Neurala Brain to market.  Our smart, fast, anywhere brain works on systems from single board computers to large servers."	https://images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_170,w_170,f_auto,b_white,q_auto:eco,dpr_4/v1484680162/lyf1x5x2kti1hacy5mb1.png
